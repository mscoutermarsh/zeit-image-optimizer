### Faster page loads
Effortlessly reduce the size of your images.

### Audit your app
Analyze every image in your deployment. Gain insights into what can be optimized further.
See all the potential bytes you could save your users.

### Lossless optimization
It's the best kind of optimization there is. No one likes blurry images. That's why we use lossless. Excess data is removed from the files without touching image quality. Same super sharp images, just smaller and faster.

### Future
This was built very quickly, potential ways to make it even better.

- Store data in dynamo (so can go beyond 100kb limit)
- Run after every deploy automatically and send notifications on changes
- Track scores over time
- Support SVGs
- Download all files in a Zip at once
- Configurable quality settings (for example, could set to auto optimize to 90%)

### ‚ù§Ô∏è Zeit Hackathon
This was built in a day for the [Zeit Hackathon](https://zeit.co/hackathon). The code is... special. üòé
